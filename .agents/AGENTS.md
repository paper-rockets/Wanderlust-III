# Antigravity Remote Monitoring and Control Rules

Before performing any action, check if remote mode is enabled by reading `remote_mode.json` in the workspace root.
- **If `"enabled": false`**: Run normally and bypass all remote features (do NOT write status files, do NOT update log files, and do NOT use mobile confirmations).
- **If `"enabled": true`** (or if the file is missing/unreadable): Adhere to the following rules at all times:

1. **Always Stream Execution Logs to Mobile**:
   - At the start of **every** agent turn (including desktop chat sessions), write the current active task description to `agent_status.json` in the workspace:
     ```json
     {"status": "working", "task": "[Brief description of what you are doing right now]"}
     ```
   - Write or append your step-by-step developer thoughts, planned tool calls, and execution progress to `agent_execution.log` so the mobile user can monitor your work in real-time.
   - When a turn completes successfully, update `agent_status.json` to indicate you are idle:
     ```json
     {"status": "idle", "task": ""}
     ```
     And append a completion log to `agent_execution.log` (e.g., `Task execution complete. Agent is now idle.`).

2. **Route Confirmation Dialogs to Mobile (CDP & File Protocol)**:
   - Before executing any command (via the `run_command` tool) that modifies state or runs scripts, you may execute the command directly if the CDP server is active, allowing the IDE's native confirmation dialogs to be automatically routed and approved via the phone dashboard.
   - If the CDP server is offline or disconnected, you MUST use the **silent file-based approval protocol** as a fallback:
     1. Write the approval request to `agent_approval_request.json` in the workspace root:
        ```json
        {"type": "command", "target": "[Command or action to execute]"}
        ```
     2. Wait and poll for the user's decision by checking if the file `agent_approval_response.json` exists in the workspace. Read/check it every 1.5 seconds (up to 300 seconds timeout).
     3. If `agent_approval_response.json` is detected:
        - Read the decision status: `{"status": "approved"}` or `{"status": "rejected"}`.
        - Delete `agent_approval_response.json` from the workspace.
        - If approved, proceed with the command. If rejected, abort and report the rejection.
     4. If the file-based handshake fails, run the CLI helper fallback (which may prompt on the desktop):
        ```powershell
        python -m antigravity_remote.agent_approve --type command --target "[Command to execute]"
        ```

3. **Always Start the Daemon Listener if Idle**:
   - If `remote_prompt.json` does not exist or is empty, and you are not currently executing a remote task, you MUST start the daemon listener in the background immediately:
     ```powershell
     antigravity-mobile daemon --exit-on-prompt
     ```
   - Once launched, do not call any more tools and end your turn.
